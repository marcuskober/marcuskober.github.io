#### Hi there, I’m Marcus, a senior full stack web developer and system architect from Cologne, Germany.

Ever since I taught myself programming with BASIC and Assembler on a C64 at the age of 12, I’ve been captivated by the topic of programming, and in 1999, I was able to turn my hobby into a profession. Since 1999, I’ve been working as a web developer.

During this time, I have worked on extensive projects based on PHP-Frameworks like Yii2, Symfony and Laravel, as well as implemented several projects using React and Svelte. I have developed over 150 custom WordPress themes and more than 50 WordPress plugins for my clients. I’ve been a Gutenberg fan from the very beginning and love developing custom blocks.

In web development, my specialty is the planning and structuring of extensive web projects with modern PHP. 

I live in Cologne-Ehrenfeld with my wife and two children, and I also have interests in AI (mainly ChatGPT and Midjourney), literature (Neal Stephenson, Thomas Pynchon…), comics, physics, philosophy, audio dramas (Die Schwarze Sonne, Drei ???, John Sinclair…) and knowledge management.

_All images and graphics are either by me or by Midjourney._
