# What Iâ€™m doing currently

- Working full time for [tetraeder.com gmbh](https://www.tetraeder.com) as a Senior Full Stack Developer, where I'm currently moving a legacy app to Symfony.
- As a pet project, I'm working on <span class="text-pink-700 dark:text-pink-600">*PhpCodeArcheology*</span>, which is a sort of static analyzer for PHP projects that assesses code quality and helps you get your hands dirty with legacy code. <span class="text-cyan-700 dark:text-cyan-600 font-bold">Coming soon</span>
- Getting my head around **DDD** (Domain Driven Design).
- Always thinking about what to do with this site. :)
