I took a week off to decompress, visiting my parents along with my two kids, and deal with some stress.

Today the grandparents took their grandchildren to an indoor playground, and I decided to go for a little hike. I chose the mountain [Kordigast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kordigast) as my destination.

I greatly enjoyed the walk, especially because it was raining lightly and I didn't see a single person in three hours, which gave me time to relax and think.

Since the primordial sea extended in [this region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Franconia) during the entire Jurassic, great fossils of ammonites can be found, especially on fields.
